melt factor trials: 10x, 50x, 100x
parameters held constant: 
impactor size = 1 / 5 radius of planet
mantle composition of impactor = 8 wt% FeO, 42 wt% MgO, 50 - 0.00606 wt% SiO2, 0.00606 wt% V2O3 (homogeneous accretion)
P and T calculated using given relations

homogeneous accretion; deep MO
false vanadium used in heterogeneous accretion: 0.004119

impactor size = 1 / 5 radius of planet
mantle composition of impactor = 8 wt% FeO, 42 wt% MgO, 50 - 0.00606 wt% SiO2, 0.00606 wt% V2O3 (homogeneous accretion)
P and T calculated using given relations
entire mantle = MO (entire mantle is molten; h = r_planet - planet_core_radius

heterogeneous accretion for deep MO: increment FeO content by 0.02 each time. 874 iterations. upper bound 17.50 wt% starting at 0 wt% (need to add X_FeO_impactor column to the txt file)
parameters held constant:
impactor size = 1 / 5 radius of planet
mantle composition varying: Si, O and Mg decrease based on increase of FeO
planet starting composition is 8 wt% FeO, 42 wt% MgO, 50 - 0.00606 wt% SiO2, 0.00606 wt% V2O3

heterogeneous accretion for deep MO (decreasing FeO content): same as before but FeO decreasing by 0.02 instead.


# heterogeneous accretion for rapid solidification:
melt factor is 10
impactor size = 1 / 5 of planet
using same wt% FeO as in deep MO
same starting planet composition

# heterogeneous accretion (rapid solidification): decrementing FeO from 17.52 wt%
check vanadium for all of the above
