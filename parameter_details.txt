melt factor trials: 10x, 50x, 100x
parameters held constant: 
impactor size = 1 / 5 radius of planet
mantle composition of impactor = 8 wt% FeO, 42 wt% MgO, 50 - 0.00606 wt% SiO2, 0.00606 wt% V2O3 (homogeneous accretion)

=============
heterogeneous accretion: trying out all whole number percentages from 0 to 20
parameters held constant:
impactor size = 1 / 10 radius of planet
mantle composition varying: Si and Mg decrease based on increase of
